# Churn-Modelling
Solution to a simple churn-modelling problem, where given a sample dataset from a business (specifically a bank for this example) you have to train an ANN to predict which clients are about to leave the bank soon

This model can be used in a variety of cases, where analysis of data is required in order to predict which clients are to take a specific action

The script was made using Python 3.6 and Keras framework in Spyder IDE. Feel free to modify it and use it as you wish
